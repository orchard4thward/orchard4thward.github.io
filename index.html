<h1>Church Services Suspended</h1>
<code>
Dear Brothers and Sisters,
<br/><br/>
<div>
                We have received notice from the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles relating to the changing conditions of COVID-19 throughout the world.  After having considered the counsel of many church leaders, government officials and medical professionals and sought the guidance of the Lord in these matters the church is announcing beginning late yesterday March 12th that all public gatherings of Church members are being temporarily suspended worldwide until further notice.
<br/><br/>
                This means for the time being until further instructed there will be no Sunday meetings in our buildings such as sacrament meeting, leadership meetings and other large gatherings. We encourage members to study in their homes the Come Follow Me lessons and do their worshiping in their own homes.  We are counseling with our Stake Presidency to determine how to make the sacrament available to members at least once a month. Until those decisions are made, we remind ward members that the ordinance of the Sacrament is to be administered under the direction of Bishop.
<br/><br/>
                We encourage members in their ministering efforts to care for one another. We are encouraged to follow the Savior&#39;s example to bless and lift others.
<br/><br/>
<h3>Temporary Sacrament Approval</h3>
After counseling with the Stake Presidency we are now authorizing all worthy priesthood holders
(Priests, Elders &amp; High Priests) to administer the sacrament to their families each Sunday. We thank you for
your patience waiting for this accommodation to be announced. Because the sacrament is the holiest
ordinance performed outside the temples, we recommend that individuals and families prepare for the
ordinance in an appropriate manner. In sacrament meeting we prepare with hymns, a prayer, and in the
manner we dress and act. Please ponder what actions you can take as individuals and families to keep this
ordinance sacred in the walls of your own home during this temporary arrangement.
<p>
Sincerely,
</p>
<p>
Orchard 4th Ward Bishopric
